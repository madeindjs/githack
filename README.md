## Dependencies

You need to install [Git][git].

Exemple for Debian based distributions:

```bash
$ sudo apt install git
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'githack'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install githack

## Usage

### As library

Simply use tis to clone the remote repository in your temporary folder

```ruby
require 'githack'

repository = Githack::Repositories::Rails::v4.new 'https://github.com/RaspberryCook/website'
```

And then you can search on repository using `databases` or `secrets` who returns `Array<Githack::Leak>`. `Githack::Leak` contains `sha`, `file` and `content`:

```ruby
repository.databases.each do |leak|
  # <Githack::Leak:Githack::Leak:0x00556db18af998 ...  >,
  puts leak.sha
  # => 566fac779248c345192512423770f14cf4af1435
  puts leak.file
  # => /tmp/https___github_com_madeindjs_fooder/config/database.yml
  puts leak.content
  # "development:\n" +
  # "  adapter: mysql2\n" +
  # "  database: raspberry_cook\n" +
  # "  encoding: utf8\n" +
  # "  username: raspberry_cook\n" +
  # "  password: secret\n" +
  # "  host:  localhost\n" +
end

repository.secrets.each do |leak|
  # ....
end
```

Theses methods will:

1. Search all commit were file changed

3. Filter only usefull informations
